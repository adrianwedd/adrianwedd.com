This site is a workshop. Not a brochure, not a CV, not a carefully curated facade. It's where I build things, think out loud, and occasionally break things in public.

I've been making software for a long time. Some of it good, some of it instructive. The best work I've done has always happened at the intersection of technical craft and genuine curiosity — and that's what this space is for.

More to come. The door is open.
