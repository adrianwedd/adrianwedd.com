NotebookLM Studio overview of Tanda Pizza — a static website built for an Italian restaurant in Lovina, Bali. The conversation explores the technical and design constraints of building for patchy connectivity, WhatsApp-first communication patterns, and honest representation.

The site needed to work the way the restaurant works: simply, in five languages (English, Italian, Dutch, Indonesian, Chinese), with gluten-free kitchen information surfaced clearly because the restaurant takes contamination seriously. No CMS, no database, no pretending to be bigger than a small pizzeria among the rice paddies.

The constraint was honesty. A website that loads fast on a patchy connection, answers the questions people actually have, and gets out of the way.
