What happens when you build a website for a pizzeria surrounded by rice paddies in northern Bali? You confront a set of constraints most web projects never face: patchy connectivity, five languages (English, Italian, Dutch, Indonesian, Chinese), WhatsApp as the primary communication channel, and the need to be honest about what a small restaurant actually is.

This episode walks through those constraints and the decisions they forced. How do you surface gluten-free kitchen information clearly when the restaurant takes contamination seriously? How do you build for a connection that drops mid-scroll? How do you represent a place without pretending it's something bigger than it is?

No CMS, no database, no cleverness for its own sake. Just a site that loads fast, answers the questions people actually have, and gets out of the way.
