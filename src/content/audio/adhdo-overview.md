NotebookLM Studio overview generated from ADHDo research materials. Explores the design challenges of building AI assistants for ADHD executive function without replicating neurotypical productivity frameworks.

The conversation covers the three-stage cognitive pipeline (state gathering, reasoning with confidence gating, tools execution), crisis detection systems that monitor for frustrated language and task-switching chaos, and hyperfocus management that respects flow state. Most importantly: the design principle that executive function is a variable, not a constant — and scaffolding should adapt to the shape of the day.

No shame. No guilt. No disappointed notification tone.
