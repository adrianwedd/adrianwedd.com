Most productivity tools assume executive function is a constant. For ADHD brains, it isn't. It's a variable that shifts across the day, the week, the season. ADHDo starts from that premise and builds outward.

This episode digs into the architecture of an AI assistant that doesn't just recreate neurotypical task managers with friendlier colours. It covers the three-stage cognitive pipeline—state gathering, reasoning with confidence gating, tools execution—and why each stage exists. Crisis detection that monitors for frustrated language and task-switching chaos. Hyperfocus management that respects flow state instead of interrupting it.

The deeper question: how do you build scaffolding that adapts to the shape of the day without introducing shame? No guilt. No disappointed notification tone. Just structure that meets you where you are.
