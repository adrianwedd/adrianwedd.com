A sequencer inspired by Playtronica's Orbita — four concentric track rings with 16-step patterns, enhanced with Meta's MusicGen for real-time AI sample generation from text prompts.

Pre-configured genre packs (Detroit techno, Berlin 90s, UK Garage). Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Web Audio API, and a FastAPI backend for AudioCraft integration.
