The AI agent ecosystem has a curation problem. New frameworks appear weekly, each claiming autonomy, each backed by a README full of superlatives and a demo that works exactly once. If you're trying to choose tooling for real work—multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines, dev tooling—the landscape is a fog of marketing copy and GitHub stars that measure hype, not quality.

I built the Agentic Index because I was tired of doing the same evaluation triage every time I started a new project. It's a scored, curated catalogue of autonomous AI tooling with a transparent methodology: what it does, how mature it is, whether it actually works under load. Data-driven scoring, fast search, available as a PyPI package for CLI access.

This is not a neutral aggregator. It's opinionated by design. The index the ecosystem needed but nobody was maintaining honestly.
