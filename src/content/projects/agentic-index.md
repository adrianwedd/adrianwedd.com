A scored and curated index of autonomous AI tooling — LLM agents, multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, and dev tools. Data-driven scoring methodology, fast search, transparent metrics.

Available as a PyPI package for CLI access. The index the AI agent ecosystem needed but nobody was maintaining honestly.
