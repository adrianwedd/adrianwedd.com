A sequential diagnosis benchmark using five specialised physician personas — Hypothesis Generator, Test Chooser, Challenger, Stewardship Officer, and Checklist Validator — working through 304 NEJM Clinical Pathological Conference cases.

Budget manager with CPT/CMS cost mapping. FHIR integration for healthcare interoperability. Statistical significance testing with permutation tests. The question isn't whether AI can diagnose — it's whether it can diagnose responsibly.
