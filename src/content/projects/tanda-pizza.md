Tanda Pizza sits among the rice paddies in Lovina, Bali. Authentic Italian food in a place where the nearest reliable internet connection is a philosophical concept. The website needed to work the way the restaurant works: simply, in multiple languages, and without requiring infrastructure that doesn't exist.

It's a fast, static site — no server, no CMS, no database. WhatsApp integration for reservations, because that's how Bali communicates. Gluten-free kitchen information surfaced clearly, because the restaurant takes contamination seriously and the website should reflect that. Five languages: English, Italian, Dutch, Indonesian, and Chinese—covering the tourists who actually walk through the door.

The constraint was honesty. A small restaurant in a rice paddy doesn't need a website that pretends to be something bigger than it is. It needs one that loads fast on a patchy connection, answers the questions people actually have, and gets out of the way.
