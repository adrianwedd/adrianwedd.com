A CV is a strange document. It claims to summarise a career, but the format enforces a lie: that work is linear, that skills accumulate neatly, that the most recent role is the most important one. Every static résumé is a snapshot that begins decaying the moment you export the PDF.

This is not a static résumé. It's a living document that updates as the work evolves—built with multi-locale support because the work has crossed borders and languages, designed to be read rather than skimmed. The structure reflects how I actually think about a career: not as a ladder, but as a series of problems that taught me things I didn't know I needed to learn.

The multi-locale architecture matters because translation isn't just about changing words—it's about changing how competence is signalled across cultures. The same experience presented to a Japanese employer needs different emphasis than when presented to an Australian one. Not dishonesty. Contextual framing.

The document lives in version control. Changes are tracked, dated, and reversible. When the work shifts, the CV shifts with it—not in six months when I remember to update a Word file, but immediately, as part of the same thought process that shaped the work itself.

A professional document should be as alive as the career it represents.
