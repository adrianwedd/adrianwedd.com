A CV is a strange document. It purports to summarise a career, but the format enforces a lie: that work is linear, that skills accumulate neatly, that the most recent role is the most important one. Every static résumé is a snapshot that begins decaying the moment you export the PDF.

This is not a static résumé. It's a living document that updates as the work evolves—built with multi-locale support because the work has crossed borders and languages, designed to be read rather than skimmed. The structure reflects how I actually think about a career: not as a ladder, but as a series of problems that taught me things I didn't know I needed to learn.
