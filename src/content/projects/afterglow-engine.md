Distils completed audio work into reusable sonic pigments. Pad mining, drone generation, granular clouds, hiss and air textures — all extracted from your existing catalogue and output as 44.1kHz WAV files optimised for hardware samplers.

149 tests, CI/CD with performance regression detection. STFT caching with 100,000x speedup. The premise: your best sounds already exist in your past work. You just need to find them.
