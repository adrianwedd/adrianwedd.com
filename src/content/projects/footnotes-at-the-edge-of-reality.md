There's a moment when you realise memory isn't retrieval—it's reconstruction. Every time you remember something, you're not accessing a stored file. You're building it again, from fragments, under different lighting, with a slightly different hand. The boundary between observation and construction dissolves the moment you try to locate it.

*Footnotes at the Edge of Reality* is a long-form poem about that dissolution. It tracks perception as an active process, not a passive recording—the way attention shapes what gets encoded, the way language constrains what can be recalled, the way each act of remembering subtly rewrites what was remembered.

The poem is rendered as an interactive web experience built with Astro. Generative canvas backgrounds shift as you read, never quite the same twice—a visual echo of the poem's central claim. The footnotes that give the piece its title accumulate as you progress, layering context and commentary until the apparatus threatens to overwhelm the primary text. Which is the point. The scaffolding we use to understand experience isn't separate from the experience. It's load-bearing.

This is a poem that needed to be a website because the form is part of the argument. You can't separate the text from the interface any more than you can separate a memory from the act of remembering it.
