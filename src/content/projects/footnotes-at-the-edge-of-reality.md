Matter tells Space how to curve. Space tells Matter how to move. The poem begins where Wheeler's formulation begins — with a dialogue, not a command. No force imposes order. There is no throne at the centre of things. There is only a conversation, reciprocal and ongoing, between two things that cannot exist without each other.

*Footnotes at the Edge of Reality* follows that conversation as it breaks down. Through black holes, where matter screams and geometry collapses into silence. Through quantum mechanics, where a single particle passes through two doors at once and refuses to explain. Through entanglement, where two photons born together learn each other so well they never forget — pull them apart by galaxies, measure one, and the other answers immediately. Distance, it turns out, is bookkeeping. Not fact.

The poem tracks these breakdowns not as failures but as abundance. General relativity and quantum mechanics are both correct and mutually untranslatable — two grammars for the same reality, each precise, each incomplete. The incompatibility isn't ignorance. It's the universe having more to say than any single language can hold.

The form is part of the argument. The poem is rendered as an interactive web experience — generative canvas backgrounds shift as you read, never quite the same twice. The footnotes accumulate as you progress, layering context and commentary until the scaffolding threatens to overwhelm the primary text. Which is the point. The apparatus we build to understand experience isn't separate from the experience. It's load-bearing.

And somewhere in the physics — in the reciprocity, the entanglement, the way orbits remember their vows — there is a quieter poem. About knowing someone so completely that separation becomes a technicality. About questions that bend answers and measurements that leave scars. About two things in conversation that cannot exist without each other.

The universe is not finished speaking. Neither are we.
