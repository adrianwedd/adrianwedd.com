An ecosystem for 3D printed housing development — 28+ specialised AI agents coordinating land acquisition, building operations, and print logistics across a 170-acre eco village project in Cygnet, Tasmania.

32 units planned, 10 completed. 60% cost reduction vs traditional construction, 80% waste reduction, 50% carbon footprint reduction. When housing is broken, sometimes you print new answers.
