When I was six, I wrote a BASIC program to make the computer say good morning. I didn't know it then, but I was building my first executive function prosthetic — externalising a sequence my brain couldn't reliably hold on its own. I've been building workarounds ever since.

The diagnosis came forty years late. ADHD, recognised in my children first, then — slowly, reluctantly — in myself. The traits I was learning to support in them were the same ones I'd been masking since before I had language for it. The brochure never mentioned this part.

*This Wasn't in the Brochure* is a co-parenting guide for the version of family life that doesn't appear in antenatal classes. Neurodiversity-affirming, trauma-informed, and evidence-based — at least 70% of citations are peer-reviewed. Eleven chapters, seven appendices, four localised editions. It covers what happens when both parents and children are neurodivergent, when standard advice breaks against non-standard brains, and when showing up honestly is the only technique that works at two in the morning.

I wrote it using a three-AI workflow: Codex for structural reasoning and evidence synthesis, Claude for voice and narrative refinement, Gemini for adversarial review and gap analysis. Not dictation — cognitive scaffolding. The same principle as that BASIC program, scaled up. The models handled what my executive function couldn't sustain: holding the structure of a 60,000-word manuscript across months of non-linear writing. The authorship — every argument, every disclosure, every sentence that made me wince and keep it in — is mine.

The book's aesthetic draws on 16th-century maritime woodcuts: a voyage without reliable charts, navigated by dead reckoning and the willingness to stay on the water.
