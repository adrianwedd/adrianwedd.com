ordr.fm sorts chaos into harmony. A CLI tool that organises music libraries using EXIF metadata, MusicBrainz and Discogs lookups, album-centric processing, and lossless format prioritisation.

v2.5 with 90%+ test coverage across 150+ tests. Processes 10,000+ albums in 20-45 minutes. Includes an interactive PWA dashboard with waveform visualisation, offline support, and automated Google Drive backup.

The kind of tool that only gets built by someone who actually cares about their music library.
