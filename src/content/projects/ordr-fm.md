My music library is the single most curated collection I own. Decades of albums, carefully sourced, tagged with intention, organised by a system that only I fully understand. When that library outgrew the capacity of any existing organiser to handle it without mangling metadata or silently overwriting lossless files with lossy duplicates, I built the tool I needed.

ordr.fm sorts chaos into harmony. It organises music libraries using EXIF metadata, MusicBrainz and Discogs lookups, album-centric processing, and lossless format prioritisation—meaning it will never replace a FLAC with an MP3, even if the MP3 has better tags. Zero-overwrite safety as a first principle, not an afterthought.

It processes ten thousand albums in twenty to forty-five minutes. An interactive PWA dashboard provides waveform visualisation, offline support, and automated Google Drive backup. Ninety percent test coverage across a hundred and fifty tests, because a tool that touches your music library needs to earn trust before it earns features.

The kind of software that only gets built by someone with something to lose.
