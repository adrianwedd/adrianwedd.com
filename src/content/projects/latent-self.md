An art installation that reflects you back — differently. Real-time face morphing via StyleGAN2-ADA with adjustable transformation axes: age, gender, smile, species, beauty. Six emotion presets mapped to latent space directions.

Fullscreen kiosk mode for gallery installations. MQTT heartbeat for remote monitoring. The mirror that shows you who you almost are.
