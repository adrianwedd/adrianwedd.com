A mirror shows you what you are. This installation shows you what you almost are.

*Latent Self* is a real-time face-morphing mirror built on StyleGAN2-ADA. You stand in front of it and it reflects you back—but shifted along axes you choose: age, gender, smile, species, beauty. Six emotion presets map to directions in latent space, each one a vector away from the face you walked in with.

The experience is uncanny in a way that static deepfakes are not. Because the transformation is continuous and responsive—because it tracks your face and morphs in real time—it feels less like looking at a fake and more like looking at a possibility. The discomfort is productive. It sits in the gap between recognition and estrangement, the same gap that makes mirrors interesting in the first place.

Fullscreen kiosk mode for gallery installations. MQTT heartbeat for remote monitoring. The technical infrastructure is deliberately invisible—the piece works when the technology disappears and all that remains is the question it asks.
