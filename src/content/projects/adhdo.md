ADHDo is an AI assistant built specifically for ADHD executive function support. It uses a Claude V2 cognitive engine with 28+ specialised agent personas, real-time chat, ambient nudge systems, and a focus music library of 5,000+ tracks.

Sub-3-second response times optimised for ADHD attention spans. Multi-device orchestration with Google Nest speakers. A celebration engine for progress tracking. No shame, no guilt — just scaffolding for the way your brain actually works.

Built with FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL, Telegram Bot API, and Google APIs for calendar and fitness integration.
