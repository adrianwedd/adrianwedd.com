Most productivity tools are built for brains that can hold a queue. If you can't—if the queue collapses the moment something shiny crosses your peripheral vision—those tools don't fail gracefully. They fail judgmentally. Missed reminders become evidence. Incomplete lists become character flaws. The tool that was supposed to help starts generating shame as a byproduct.

I built ADHDo because I needed an assistant that understood executive function as a variable, not a constant. Not a todo list with encouragement bolted on—a cognitive scaffold that adapts to the shape of the day. Twenty-eight specialised agent personas handle different modes: crisis detection when the spiral starts, ambient nudges when focus drifts, a celebration engine that marks progress without making it performative.

The constraint that shaped the architecture was attention itself. Sub-three-second response times, because three seconds is the window before an ADHD brain decides the interaction isn't worth sustaining. Multi-device orchestration through Google Nest speakers, so the scaffold exists in the room, not behind a screen. A focus music library of five thousand tracks, because sometimes the right frequency is the only executive function that works.

No shame. No guilt. No disappointed notification tone. Just scaffolding for the way your brain actually works—built by someone whose brain works the same way.
