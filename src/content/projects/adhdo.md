Most productivity tools are built for brains that can hold a queue. If you can't — if the queue collapses the moment something shiny crosses your peripheral vision — those tools don't fail gracefully. They fail judgmentally. Missed reminders become evidence. Incomplete lists become character flaws.

ADHDo is the assistant I built because I needed executive function treated as a variable, not a constant. Not a todo list with encouragement bolted on — a cognitive scaffold that adapts to the shape of the day.

The system runs a three-stage cognitive pipeline. A state gatherer reads physical, temporal, and environmental context — medication windows, sitting duration, task backlog, energy levels. A reasoning engine with confidence gating processes that state; it won't act unless it understands the situation. Then a tools executor orchestrates interventions: focus music, timers, ambient nudges, environment controls. The loop closes in under 450 milliseconds on average — well inside the three-second window before an ADHD brain decides an interaction isn't worth sustaining. Google Nest speakers put the scaffold in the room, not behind a screen. A Jellyfin-powered focus music library of five thousand tracks auto-categorises by mood — because sometimes the right frequency is the only executive function that works.

The crisis detection system monitors for repetitive questions, frustrated language, task-switching chaos, and negative self-talk, then intervenes with de-escalation — not platitudes. Hyperfocus management detects extended sessions and suggests breaks without breaking flow state.

No shame. No guilt. No disappointed notification tone. Just scaffolding for the way your brain actually works.
