The best samples come from places you weren't looking. That's the premise—and the entire workflow. Type a random word. Get a sample pack. dodgylegally generates audio instruments from chaotic search phrases, pulling from YouTube, local files, and a five-thousand-word dictionary with weighted source mixing.

I built this because I wanted to break the loop of scrolling through sample libraries looking for something that "felt right." The feeling never arrives by browsing. It arrives by accident—by hearing a texture you didn't know existed, shaped by a word you chose for no reason. The tool's job is to manufacture those accidents reliably.

One-shot and loop processing with cross-fading. BPM-aware looping and beat alignment. Pitch shifting, time stretching, stem export. Every sound carries a JSON sidecar tracking its provenance—where it came from, what transformations were applied, what the original search term was. Because creative chaos is better when it's reproducible chaos.

The name is the philosophy: sampling from the wild, with just enough attribution to sleep at night.
