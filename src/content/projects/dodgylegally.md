Type a random word. Get a sample pack. dodgylegally generates audio instruments from chaotic search phrases — pulling from YouTube, local files, and a 5,000-word dictionary with weighted source mixing.

One-shot and loop processing with cross-fading. BPM-aware looping and beat alignment. Pitch shifting, time stretching, stem export. Provenance tracking with JSON sidecars so you know where every sound came from. 283 passing tests.
