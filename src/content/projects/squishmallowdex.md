I built this for a friend's kid. That's the whole origin story.

She collects Squishmallows—those soft, round plush toys that have somehow colonised every shelf in the house. She wanted to know which ones she had, which ones she wanted, and which ones existed that she hadn't seen yet. The answer, it turns out, is over three thousand. (My own two kids have a few Squishmallows too, so they've been enthusiastic beta testers.)

The Squishmallowdex is a Pokedex-style tracker scraped from the wiki. Search by name, filter by squad, mark favourites, track what you own. It's an offline-capable PWA that works on tablets, because that's where kids live. The interface is simple enough for a seven-year-old to navigate without asking for help, which is a harder design constraint than most enterprise dashboards ever face.

Not every project needs to advance the state of the art. Some just need to make a small person's eyes light up.
