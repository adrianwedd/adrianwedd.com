A friend mentioned her 10yo son was researching squishmallows and I asked if I could help. A few hours later I discovered I was starving but the first release had been released. Designed to be educational (running terminal commands and the like, great kid-friendly logging) as well as create an offline squishmallow resource (no ads!) A few hours more work and it's pretty robust. Take a closer look.
