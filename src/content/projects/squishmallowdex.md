I built this for my kids. That's the whole origin story.

They collect Squishmallows—those soft, round plush toys that have somehow colonised every shelf in the house. They wanted to know which ones they had, which ones they wanted, and which ones existed that they hadn't seen yet. The answer, it turns out, is over three thousand.

The Squishmallowdex is a Pokedex-style tracker scraped from the wiki. Search by name, filter by squad, mark favourites, track what you own. It's an offline-capable PWA that works on tablets, because that's where my kids live. The interface is simple enough for a seven-year-old to navigate without asking for help, which is a harder design constraint than most enterprise dashboards ever face.

Not every project needs to advance the state of the art. Some just need to make a small person's eyes light up.
