A friend mentioned her 10-year-old was researching Squishmallows. I asked if I could help. A few hours later I looked up from my screen, realized I was starving, and discovered I'd built and shipped the first release.

It's designed to be educational—running terminal commands, showing kid-friendly logs, teaching how data gets scraped and structured. It's also an offline-capable resource with no ads, no tracking, no parent-hostile dark patterns. Just a fast, local database of every Squishmallow that exists.

Another few hours of work made it actually robust. Offline PWA. Search, filter, favorites, collection tracking. Over 3,000 plush creatures catalogued.

Take a closer look if you're building for kids, or just want to see what hyperfocus and a good excuse can produce in an afternoon.
