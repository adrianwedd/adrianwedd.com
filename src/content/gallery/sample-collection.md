Some ideas arrive as images before they have words. This collection holds visual experiments—not finished work, not portfolio pieces, but thinking made visible. Process documentation from projects that needed to show rather than tell. Patterns noticed in code structure, failure cascades, system behaviour. The kind of sketches that accumulate when you're working through a problem and realise the diagram matters more than the explanation.

The gallery fills slowly. Not because there isn't material—there's years of it—but because publishing visual work requires a different kind of vulnerability than publishing text. These are the pieces ready to be seen.
