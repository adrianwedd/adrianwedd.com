# DESIGN CHARTER: adrianwedd.com

This document defines **intent, constraints, and authority** for the project.

It is not a task list.
It is not a technical specification—though it settles platform commitments as intentional constraints.
It does not describe *how* to implement features.

It exists to answer one question only:

> **What must remain true, no matter how the project evolves?**

All execution details are delegated to tickets, plans, and code.
All work should be judged against this charter.

## 1. What This Project Is

This is a **living workshop**.

It is the professional home of a creative technologist—a place where finished work, ongoing experiments, and raw thinking coexist. The site is both the portfolio and an exhibit in itself: its infrastructure, automation, and intelligence are part of the work being showcased.

A visitor should feel they've walked into somewhere inhabited—warm, opinionated, technically surprising. Not a brochure. Not a CV. A space where someone clearly works and thinks.

---

## 2. What This Project Is Not

This project is **not**:

- a template portfolio with interchangeable content
- a purely static document
- a corporate or institutional presence
- a showcase of frameworks for their own sake
- a sterile developer portfolio

The technology serves the content and the visitor. If a technical feature doesn't make the experience more interesting, personal, or useful, it doesn't belong.

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Warm Technical Craft

The engineering should be visible but never cold. Code aesthetics, terminal echoes, and build artifacts can surface—but in service of personality, not intimidation.

The site should feel like it was made by a person, not generated by a pipeline.

### 3.2 Dark-First, Sensory-Aware

- Dark mode is the default aesthetic. Light mode is fully supported with equal readability and usability. User preference always overrides the default.
- Long reading sessions should be comfortable. Low glare, considered typography.
- Rich but restrained colour palette—more range than monochrome, but never garish. The palette's emotional register is botanical and earthen: plum-tinted darks, dusty copper accent, mauve grays. Warm like weathered materials, not bright like signage. The mood reference is autumn, dried flowers, things that have been worn in.
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum compliance across both modes. Colour contrast ratios enforced.

### 3.3 Content Wants to Be Found

- Smart cross-linking between projects, posts, audio, and galleries. Nothing exists in isolation.
- Visitors should stumble into things they didn't know they were looking for.
- Navigation is an invitation, not a filing system.
- Taxonomy spans content types: a tag connects a blog post to a project to an audio episode.
- All content requires: tags (minimum 1), content type, and publication date. Cross-links auto-generate from shared tags. Manual links override.

### 3.4 The Site Is Alive

- Dynamic, personalised elements respond to who is visiting and when.
- Build-time automation keeps content fresh without manual intervention.
- The site should feel like it updates itself—because, largely, it does.
- **When personalisation or external services fail, the site falls back to a fully functional static experience.** No feature requires personalisation to work. The default experience is the complete experience.

### 3.5 Publish Friction Is the Enemy

- If it takes more than a commit to publish, the workflow is broken.
- Auto-discovery, scaffolding, and smart defaults reduce the gap between "made something" and "shared something."
- Content tooling (NotebookLM-style automation, image pipelines) supports the workflow but must never become a bottleneck. If tagging or classification slows publishing, simplify the taxonomy.

### 3.6 Accessibility Is Non-Negotiable

- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum compliance. AAA where achievable without compromising design intent.
- Keyboard navigation works everywhere.
- Screen reader testing is a requirement, not an afterthought.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animation.
- Easter eggs and CLI-style interactions are built on an accessible foundation—they add to the experience but are never required for it.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Stack

- **Static site built with Astro** — static generation (SSG) for all content. Personalisation handled client-side.
- Deployed to **GitHub Pages** via GitHub Actions from `main` branch.
- DNS managed at Cloudflare.
- Content authored in **Markdown** with frontmatter metadata.
- Interactive islands using **Preact** (lightweight, React-compatible). Vanilla JS preferred where island complexity is low.
- Media assets stored in-repo under `public/` — images, audio, and generated assets.

### 4.2 Content Sections

- **Projects** — rich showcase pages for major works (thiswasntinthebrochure.wtf, failurefirst.org, Footnotes at the Edge of Reality, etc.)
- **Blog** — essays, technical writing, thinking-out-loud
- **Gallery** — photography and image collections
- **Audio** — podcast episodes, NotebookLM exports, other audio work
- **About/CV** — professional context, living document

### 4.3 Intelligence Layer

- **Google Analytics 4** integrated—not just tracking, but powering features and demonstrating analytics engineering mastery.
- Visitor-aware personalisation: bespoke generated images, adaptive content, contextual recommendations.
- The experience adapts for returning visitors—the site remembers and responds.
- Analytics dashboard exposed as content—transparency as craft.
- The personalisation itself is a showcase: "here's what I built, and here's how it sees you."
- **Analytics must not block page render.** All tracking and personalisation scripts load asynchronously as progressive enhancement. Maximum 50KB transfer for analytics-related resources.

### 4.4 Automation & CI

- **Local-first during development** — scripts and tooling run locally, graduating to GitHub Actions when patterns are proven and cost-justified.
- Auto-generates galleries from directories, pulls project metadata from repos, optimises images, cross-links content.
- NotebookLM-style tooling for content generation and research.
- Auto-scaffolding for new content types.
- Build logs and pipeline status surfaced on-site as a feature.

### 4.5 Privacy & Data Ethics

This is not optional. It is a constraint with the same weight as any architectural decision.

- **Consent before collection.** No non-essential cookies or tracking before explicit visitor consent. The site works fully without cookies.
- **No cross-site tracking.** No third-party data sharing. No fingerprinting.
- **Personalisation is anonymous.** Coarse-grained segments only. No personally identifiable information stored or processed.
- **Data minimisation.** Collect only what powers a visible feature. If a data point doesn't serve the visitor, don't collect it.
- **Retention cap.** Client-side personalisation data expires. Server-side analytics follow GA4 defaults with no extensions.
- **User control.** Visitors can see what the site knows about them, reset their profile, or opt out entirely—without losing access to content.
- **Geographic respect.** EU visitors receive GDPR-compliant handling. Consent mechanisms adapt to jurisdiction.
- **The public analytics dashboard never exposes individual visitor data.** Aggregates only.

Hospitality means: minimal data, transparent use, easy opt-out. If a personalisation feature can't be built within these constraints, it doesn't get built.

### 4.6 Performance Budget

- **Lighthouse Performance score:** ≥ 90 on mobile (simulated throttling).
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 (p75 mobile).
- **JavaScript budget:** < 100KB first-load (compressed). Islands load on interaction or viewport entry.
- **No blocking third-party scripts on first render.** All external resources (analytics, personalisation, embeds) load asynchronously.
- **Images:** WebP with AVIF where supported. Responsive srcsets. Lazy loading below the fold.
- **Audio:** MP3 baseline. Streaming where possible. No auto-play.

## 5. Personalisation & Visitor Experience

### 5.1 The Site Responds

- First-time visitors get a considered default experience—complete, not degraded.
- Returning visitors encounter subtle differences—the site remembers and adapts.
- Generative imagery responds to inferred preferences, referral source, time of day, browsing patterns.
- This is not surveillance. It is hospitality. The distinction is maintained by the constraints in section 4.5—not by intention alone, but by architecture.

### 5.2 Progressive Disclosure

- **Surface layer:** clean, inviting, immediately navigable.
- **Deeper layer:** technical detail, source links, build metadata for those who look.
- **Hidden layer:** easter eggs, CLI-style interactions, discoveries for the curious. All built on accessible foundations (see 3.6).

### 5.3 Transparency

- What the site knows about you is visible if you ask.
- Analytics data is not hidden behind a login—it's part of the content.
- The personalisation itself is a showcase: "here's what I built, and here's how it sees you."
- Visitors can reset or opt out at any time (see 4.5).

## 6. Voice

The site's written voice follows the principles documented in `STYLE.md` (sourced from aisi-apps). Key characteristics:

- **Philosophical but grounded** — systems thinking, not abstraction for its own sake.
- **Structurally precise** — "This is not X. It is Y."
- **First-person immediate** — direct, lived experience, never third-person achievement listing.
- **Rhythmic** — short declarative sentences for emphasis, strategic repetition, colons as thought connectors.
- **Australian English** throughout (organisation, realise, behaviour). Oxford comma. Em dashes without spaces.

What the voice is **not**: achievement listing, corporate buzzwords, hedging without epistemic purpose, over-formal.

---

## 7. Decision Hierarchy

This charter governs. Implementation details live in tickets and code.

When there is conflict, this is the priority order:

1. **Legal/privacy** — compliance is not negotiable.
2. **Accessibility** — overrides cleverness, always.
3. **Performance** — the visitor's time is respected.
4. **Warmth** — wins over impressiveness.
5. **Publishing** — wins over perfecting.
6. **The visitor's experience** — wins over the builder's preferences.

## 8. Closing

This site does not promise completeness.
It does not promise polish.
It does not promise explanation.

It promises only this:

> The work will be visible, the craft will be honest,
> and the door will be open.

That is the contract.
